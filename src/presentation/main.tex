% \begin{frame}{Why analyse historical records?}
% 	Petrakis et al. reflect on the importance of digitising ship logbooks of the 19\textsuperscript{th} and 20\textsuperscript{th} century:
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Helps them analyse the transition from sail to steam navigation in the Mediterranean
% 		\begin{itemize}
% 			\item Change in trade routes
% 			\item Changes in duration of voyage
% 			\item Steam ships having to stay shore longer than sail boats due to repairs and servicing
% 		\end{itemize}
% 		\item Local cultural and political factors
% 		\item Uncover details about the working and living conditions and social relations on board

% 		\vspace{0.5em}

% 			\begin{quote}
% 				``In the margin of the logbook [the captain] wrote twice about his disappointment and frustration...reflecting the anxiety and psychological strain on some people working at sea."

% 	Analysing registers or logbooks is a difficult yet incredibly important task for historical research.\footnotemark
	
% 	\vspace{1em}

% 		\item Data digitisation
% 		\item Data curation
% 		\item Data exploration
% 	\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Introduction to the dataset}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The dataset contained 7609 records spanning 101 years from 1883 to 1983.
		\item The format was typical of most manually-collected datasets.
		\item No cleaning had been conducted on the dataset, other than basic checks during entry.
		\item All data was de-identified in line with USYD's Human Research Ethics Committee approval.\footnotemark

	\subsection{Project scope}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The scope for SCDL3991}
		% This was my first time working with first-hand historical data 
		% At uni, data is polished by coordinators before setting it for analysis

	\begin{alertblock}{Original project aim}
		Compare cause of death with place of death to uncover trends in regards to how and where people died.
	\end{alertblock}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Updated project aim}
		Improve the data quality of the Asset Register dataset and bring it into a state useable for analysis.
	\end{exampleblock}

	\vspace{1em}
	% This was our aim \textit{under the assumption that the data would be in a programmatically useable state.}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}{The scope for SCDL3991}

% 	{\large \textbf{This project is the product of discovering that historical data -- especially hand-transcribed data -- is rarely ready for analysis out of the box.}}

% 	\vspace{1em}

% 	\onslide{Why?}
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item<2-> Records are usually transcribed in the pursuit of retaining history, not necessarily for the purposes of analysis. % Talk about people coming to the Anatomy records to find information about their ancestor.
% 		\item<3-> The process of digitising old records written in cursive script is incredibly laborious and error-prone.
% 	\end{itemize}
% 	% As a result, our project aim shifted.

% \end{frame}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}{The scope for SCDL3991}

% 	\begin{exampleblock}{Updated project aim}
% 		Improve the data quality of the Asset Register dataset and bring it into a state useable for analysis.
% 	\end{exampleblock}

% 	\vspace{1em}

% 	We will demonstrate our success by performing a geographical analysis on the ``place of death" attribute.

	\section{Methodology: The Pain}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}{A note on exclusivity}

% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item The following section will present some data quality issues found in the Anatomy Registers dataset.
% 		\item The data quality issues which will be presented in this section are \textbf{not unique to this project alone.}
% 		\item Consequently, the solutions we will discuss are broadly applicable and not restricted solely to this dataset.

% \end{frame}

	Potential solutions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Delete the missing entry
		\item Replace with a statistical summary (mean/median)
		\item Impute the missing value based on context

% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Until about 1950, almost all donors were exclusively unclaimed bodies from public and mental asylums.
% 		\item In the 1960's there was a huge amount of donors coming from private residences.
% 		\item This reflected society's changing views on becoming a donor for anatomical purposes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

	% {\huge Working with hand-transcribed data is difficult.}
	% \vspace{0.75em}
	% \begin{itemize}
	% 	\item \pause You will need to go through a rigorous data V\&V process
	% 	\item \pause You may need to abstract certain attributes of your data due to their unstructured format
	% \end{itemize}

	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Working with hand-transcribed data poses unique challenges as a data analyst, requiring a rigorous and time-consuming data verification process.
		\item Interesting results can be achieved through structuring data to determine relationships in the dataset.
	\end{itemize}

% 	Records from the past give you an incomparable insight into society's functioning at the time.

\subsection{Limitations}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Limitations}
	The unstructured attributes in the dataset reduces data quality and limits potential statistical analysis that may uncover interesting findings.

	% Correlation and regression
	% Machine learning
	% Buzz words
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	\subsection{Future work}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}{Future work}
% 	% After cleaning hundreds of entries in order to produce a cleaned version of the Anatomy Registers dataset, exploring trends in the place of death attribute was just the start of countless investigations which could unfold using this data.
% \end{frame}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Future work}
	\framesubtitle{Further standardisation of place of death}
	As a result, it is important to spend more time cleaning and structuring the data and attributes to allow for complex analysis.

	\vspace{1em}

	e.g. How can we programmatically consolidate similar entries into one?

	\begin{figure}

	\end{figure}	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Future work}
	\framesubtitle{Further standardisation of place of death}

	We tried to achieve this using:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item String similarity techniques
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Difficult to find the one best similarity cut-off
			\item Either too harsh e.g. won't allow for absence of address
			\item Or too lenient e.g. will group \texttt{balmain district hospital} and \texttt{bowral district hospital} together
		\end{itemize}
		\item Simple ML approaches
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Attempted to use KMeans clustering (unsupervised learning) to try and cluster the entries together
			\item An issue was that we needed to specify the number of clusters, which is unknown
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

% 		Could we trace out the birth of new medical fields using this data?
% 	\end{exampleblock}

% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Psychiatry and psychology are relatively new fields in medicine, both emerging to great extent in the 19th and 20th centuries.
% 		\item Could we potentially trace out the emergence or disappearance of certain terminology in medicine, such as those for mental illness, through analysing the cause of death attribute?

	I extend my deepest appreciation to my supervisors, Dr. Rebekah Jenkin and Professor Kevin Keay, for helping me see this project through from start to finish despite the many roadblocks in the middle. This project would not have been made possible without our extensive, and often tangential, discussions.
